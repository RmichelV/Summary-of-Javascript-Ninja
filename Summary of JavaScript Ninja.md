# Javascript is everywhere

***This chapter cover***

* The core language features of Javascript
* The core items of Javascript engine
* Three best practices in JavaScript development 

Let´s start this summary talking about Bob who is a software development, who graduated in 2000's after learn how create desktop application. As the web pages had just hit stride he learned PHP so he could create dynamic web pages sprinkled with JavaScript to achieve complex functionalities like form validations. When the smartphones arrived, they opened a new market and bob didnâ€™t want keep back and learned Objective-C and Java to develop mobile apps that run on IOS and Android. Now lets talk about Ann who graduated with a degree in software development. She made web sites based on the modern Model-View-Controller, also made mobile applications that running on IOS and Android, she got to make desktop applications that runs on Windows, Linux and OS X, she has started to building a server less version of that applications entirely based in the cloud. Everything written in JavaScript. That was extraordinary because what took Bob 10 years and 5 languages to do, Ann has achieved in 2 years and in just one language. What started as a humble 10-day project back in 1995 is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, now JavaScript is getting long overdue upgrades to be more suitable for modern application development.

**1.1 Understanding the JavaScript language**

Using a vast number of elements in the languages is not enough to take beyond fundamental levels because JavaScript often using a C-like syntax because it  has a resemblance to others C-like languages such C# and Java. People often think if they know C# or Java they know JavaScript but the reality is other and they check it after writing JavaScript as if it were Java and the results are other that they expected. 

These differences include the following:

* *Functions are fist class objects* - Function can coexist and be treated like any other JavaScript objet. They can be created through literals, referenced by variables, passed around as function arguments an event return as function return values.

* *Function clouser* - Function is a closure when it actively maintains the external variables used in its body.

* *Scopes* - JavaScript didn’t have block levels variables as other C-like languages and we had to rely on global variables and function level variables. 

* *Prototype-base object orientation* - JavaScript instead use class-based object orientation like C#, Java and Ruby, uses prototypes. Many developers that come from class-based languages such Java try to use Java using the syntax of JavaScript and they have  a big impression because the results are differ than they expected. 

JavaScript consist of a close relationship between objects and prototypes and prototypes, and functions and closures, understanding those concepts you will have a strong foundation for any type of application development, regardless of whether your JavaScript code will be executed in a desktop application, web page, mobile app or on the server. 

Also exist other features of JavaScript can help you to write more elegant and efficient code in particular we will focus on the following: 

*Generators* - are function that can generate multiple values on a per-request and can suspend their execution between request. 

*Promises* - give us better control over asynchronous code 

*Proxies* -  allow us to control access to certain objects 

*Advanced array methods* - make array-handling code much more elegant 

*Maps* - we can use to create dictionary collections and sets which allow us to deal with collections of unique items. 

*Regular expression* - let us simplify what would otherwise be complicated pieces of code 

*Modules* - we can use to break code into smaller, relatively self-contained pieces that make projects more manageable 

Having a deep understanding of the fundaments and learning how to use the advanced language features to their best advantages can elevate your code to higher levels
