As the web pages had just hit stride he learned PHP so he could create dynamic web pages sprinkled with JavaScript to achieve complex functionalities like form validations. When the smartphones arrived, they opened a new market and bob didnâ€™t want keep back and learned Objective-C and Java to develop mobile apps that run on IOS and Android. Now lets talk about Ann who graduated with a degree in software development. She made web sites based on the modern Model-View-Controller, also made mobile applications that running on IOS and Android, she got to make desktop applications that runs on Windows, Linux and OS X, she has started to building a server less version of that applications entirely based in the cloud.
